# 3.6 Improve the readme file again
I’m learning Python, R, and Git because I want to feel more confident in the digital world.
Python feels like a creative playground where I can bring small ideas to life.
R gives me the chance to understand data and make sense of messy numbers.
Git reassures me, like a safety net, keeping track of my progress and mistakes.
As a beginner, I’m excited to stumble, learn, and slowly build something that feels truly mine.

# 3.7 Add a local image to the readme file

# 3.8 Summarize what you have learned
From this application, I learned the basic concepts of Git, such as how to make your own repository, to add images on your code and do some other changes and then commit and publish what I have done to share it with other members. 
Duration of the course : about 2h
